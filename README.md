# DHS-Project-ACDC
This is a Senior Project collaboration with DHS on creating an executable that can export an Excel of all property records owned by an individual. ........
Why know .exe?
  it was too big to upload to git however a flash drive with the .exe was given to DHS with the .exe, user guide, and coder guide on it.
